# **Description**
1. Loaded Data by using Pandas Library in python.
2. Data Understanding the data - Statistical Techniques.
3. Data Exploration.
4. Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
    a. Univariate analysis
    b. MultiVariate analysis
5. Converted data into Machine learning model format using Encoders,Normalization and Standardization.
6. split the data into Train,Validation and Test sets.
7. Train data is Trained using different Machine Learning Models --- Regression models and Classification Models.
8. Validated model against Valid dataset.
9. Once Model is Validated and Checked for Overfit & Underfit.
10. Once model is Generalized to Data set , check the Model with Test dataset
11. save the model using pickle or joblib for further use.
12. Created an FLASK app using model to test against newly added data points.
